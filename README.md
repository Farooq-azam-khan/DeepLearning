Here is the tutorial for Deep Learning.
Todo:
1. Preceptron Learning Algorithm
  - look at the following files: preceptron.py, linear_function.py, boolean_function.py
  - the preceptron class contains the preceptron learning algorithm
  - the linear_function.py file contains a graphical understading of how PLA
  does linear separation of data points
  - the boolean_function.py file contains examples of PLA successes as well as
  its failure, ie. the XOR problem. Look at neural_network.py for improvement to PLA.
2. Neural Network Algorithm
3. XOR problem
4. Tensorflow in python
5. CNN and Keras
