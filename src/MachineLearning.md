# Machine Learning
- give computers ability to learn with data
- types: __Supervised__ and __Unsupervised Learning__

# Supervised
- Give algorithm the right answer so it can develop
- Example algorithms: __Regression, NaÃ¯ve Based, SVM, Neural Nets__
- use a __dataset__
  - split it into __training__ and __testing__
  - __training set__ will train algorithm
  - __testing set__ will check performance

# Unsupervised
- Do not have a dataset with the right answers -> data w/out labels
- algorithm must find a pattern if it exists, called __clusters__
- Example algorithms: __K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, PCA__
