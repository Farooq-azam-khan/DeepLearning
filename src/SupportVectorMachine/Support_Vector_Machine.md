# Support Vector Machine
- http://www.saedsayad.com/support_vector_machine_reg.htm
- very popular for supervised learning classification
- works in infinite dimensions
- good separation is achieved by hyper plane that has the largest distance to the nearest training-data point of any class since in general the larger the margin the lower the generalization error of the classifier
- maximize margin
- __kernel function__: transform the problem into linearly separable
